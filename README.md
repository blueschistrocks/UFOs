# UFO Sightings 

## 

Using Javascript to build dynamic webpages and other customization tools that include D 3 Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS.

## Results
### Project Overview
The purpose of the Project was to learn how to use data that is stored in a JavaScript file as an array or list and place the data into an organized table. Using JavaScript to filter the data based on user input. The table variables can be filtered by date, city, state, country, and shape.

This webpage should include:
•	A description or summary of the topic
•	A table to display all of the information from the Java Script data source
•	Search filters that will allow for users to update the table based on the search criteria they enter.

Summary
The goal of creating an aesthetically pleasing and dynamic webpage to display the UFO sightings data was successful.  There are quite a few drawbacks to the design that could be improved upon.

- The search field is case-sensitive; therefore, the table will not update if the user does not enter a request in the filter exactly how the data is stored in the JaveScript file.
- The data is not linked to a to a current or live source.
### Recommendations
The following changes may improve the user's experience.
- Use additional sources and functionality to retrieve data from current sources.
- Create a Recent UFO News Section with articles and/or links to new UFO news.
