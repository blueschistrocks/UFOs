# UFO Sightings 

## Project Overview
The purpose of the Project was to learn how to use data that is stored in a JavaScript file as an array or list and place the data into an organized table. Using JavaScript to filter the data based on user input. The table variables can be filtered by date, city, state, country, and shape.

## Tools Used

Used JavaScript, D3, Bootstrap, HTML and CSS to build a dynamic webpage.

## Results

This webpage includes:
- A description or summary of the topic
- A table to display all of the information from the Java Script data source

The page also includes search filters that will allow for users to update the table based on search criteria such as Date, City, State Country and the shape of the UFO. Once the criteria have been entered and the "Filter Table" button is clicked the table will be updated.

Summary
The goal of creating an aesthetically pleasing and dynamic webpage to display the UFO sightings data was successful.  There are some drawbacks to the design that could be improved upon.

- The search field is case-sensitive; therefore, the table will not update if the user does not enter a request in the filter exactly how the data is stored in the JaveScript file.
- The data is not linked to a to a current or live source.
### Recommendations
The following changes may improve the user's experience:
- Use additional sources and functionality to retrieve data from current sources.
- Create a Recent UFO News Section with articles and/or links to new UFO news.
